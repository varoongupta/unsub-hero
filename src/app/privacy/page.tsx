        <p>Last updated: August 2025</p>
  
        <p>
          At Unsub Hero (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;us&quot;), we respect your privacy and are committed
          to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we
          collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our application.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Email account data you explicitly connect (such as Gmail).</li>
          <li>Metadata about senders, counts of emails, and unsubscribe/delete actions.</li>
          <li>Basic account details (name, email) provided by your authentication provider.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide the core unsubscribe and cleanup functionality.</li>
          <li>To improve the app&apos;s performance and features.</li>
          <li>To provide customer support and respond to inquiries.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>How We Protect Information</h2>
        <p>
          We use industry-standard security measures and never sell your personal
          information to third parties. Access to your data is limited to the services
          necessary to provide functionality (e.g., Gmail API).
        </p>
  
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          Our app integrates with external providers such as Google for authentication
          and email access. Your use of those services is subject to their privacy policies.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>
          You may disconnect your account or request deletion of your data at any time
          from the Settings page.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on
          this page with the revised &quot;Last updated&quot; date.
